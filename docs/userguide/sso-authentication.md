Single Sign-on Settings can be configured through `Settings > Organization Settings > Authenticated Domains (section)`.  You can use SSO settings to enable password-free login for SigNoz users. This means, the signoz will depend on Identity Providers (IdP) to provide user validity and grant access based on that.
